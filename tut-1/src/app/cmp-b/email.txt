Dear Aleksandra,

Thank you very much for your continued support and for arranging the availability of the panel members.

I sincerely apologize for requesting another change. Unfortunately, I am still not fully recovered, and my doctor has advised me to avoid screen time and discussions for a few more days.

To ensure that I can participate fully and perform at my best during the interview, I kindly request if it would be possible to reschedule the interview to Monday, 22nd December.
I would like to assure you that I will definitely be available and fully prepared on that date, and I will ensure my complete participation in the interview.

I truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and I would like to reiterate that I am highly interested in joining SITA and very enthusiastic about this opportunity.

Thank you once again for your consideration and support.

Kind regards,
Saurabh Barasiya
